# Based on the provided API flow diagram for an "Instalacao" (Installation) type order, here's a corresponding Gherkin feature file:

Feature: Installation Order Processing
Scenario: Successful Installation Order Creation
Given the user has a valid geographic address
When the user retrieves the address details using the Geographic Address Management API
And the user retrieves the address complements using the Geographic Address Management API
And the user checks the service availability for the address using the Resource Pool Management API
And the service is available for the address
And the user searches for available appointment slots using the Appointment API
And selects a suitable appointment slot
And creates an appointment with the selected slot using the Appointment API
And places an installation order with the appointment details using the ProductOrdering API
Then the installation order should be created successfully
And the order should be associated with the selected appointment

Scenario: Installation Order Creation with Partial Service Availability
Given the user has a valid geographic address
When the user retrieves the address details using the Geographic Address Management API
And the user retrieves the address complements using the Geographic Address Management API
And the user checks the service availability for the address using the Resource Pool Management API
And the service is partially available for the address
And the user searches for available appointment slots using the Appointment API
And selects a suitable appointment slot
And creates an appointment with the selected slot using the Appointment API
And places an installation order with the appointment details using the ProductOrdering API
Then the installation order should be created successfully
And the order should be associated with the selected appointment
And the order should indicate partial service availability

Scenario: Installation Order Creation Failure due to No Service Availability
Given the user has a valid geographic address
When the user retrieves the address details using the Geographic Address Management API
And the user retrieves the address complements using the Geographic Address Management API
And the user checks the service availability for the address using the Resource Pool Management API
And the service is not available for the address
Then the installation order creation should fail
And an appropriate error message should be provided indicating no service availability

# High-level description of the expected behavior for each scenario:
# 
# Successful Installation Order Creation:
# 
# The user provides a valid geographic address.
# The address details and complements are retrieved using the Geographic Address Management API.
# The service availability is checked for the address using the Resource Pool Management API.
# If the service is available, the user proceeds to search for available appointment slots using the Appointment API.
# The user selects a suitable appointment slot and creates an appointment using the Appointment API.
# The user places an installation order with the appointment details using the ProductOrdering API.
# The installation order should be created successfully and associated with the selected appointment.
# 
# 
# Installation Order Creation with Partial Service Availability:
# 
# Similar to the successful scenario, but the service availability check indicates partial availability for the address.
# The user proceeds with the appointment booking and order placement.
# The installation order should be created successfully, associated with the selected appointment, and indicate partial service availability.
# 
# 
# Installation Order Creation Failure due to No Service Availability:
# 
# The user provides a valid geographic address.
# The address details and complements are retrieved using the Geographic Address Management API.
# The service availability is checked for the address using the Resource Pool Management API.
# If the service is not available for the address, the installation order creation should fail.
# An appropriate error message should be provided to the user indicating that the service is not available for the given address.
# 
# 
# 
# These scenarios cover the main paths of the installation order creation process based on the provided API flow diagram, considering different service availability scenarios.
